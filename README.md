## assumptions on data 

  *    Invoice number and cancelled invoice numbers provided in the dataset do not match , the numerics are different - Hence Cancelled ordered are ignored in most of the analysis. However, it is included while computing TotalSales.
  *    Stock code to Description should be 1:1
  *    CustomerID cannot be null
  *    Postage charges are ignored in this analysis , however provided production costs , postage charges will be useful to evaluate the profit. 
  *    Discounts are not matching exactly with invoice and stock codes hence ignored.
  *    Price=0 is ignored in this analysis , as they dont contribute to any revenue.
